## Why start a blog?
I believe that most people would say that a blog is a waste of time, because nobody is gonna read it, and I agree that starting a blog is very much like screaming into a void, but it is better than just staring into it. To put it in less corny terms, I just want to write about my projects(and other things) and I don't mind making these posts public.

## What can you expect from this blog?
It'll mostly be me talking about my projects, so I'll try to describe what I'm doing, why I'm doing it and how I'm doing it. At the same time, I'm trying to improve my writing skills and my ability to explain difficult(to me) projects.

I'll definitely make a lot of mistakes, my approaches will contain a lot of mistakes, but I'll try to keep things entertaining and make it so if anyone ever stumbles upon this, they could learn _something_ or at least find some pleasure in my struggles.

## What kind of projects am I talking about?
Mostly systems programming related projects. To be more concrete, right now I'm working on an optimising compiler with an LLVM back-end and a very simple hardware description language written in Java(I have more things to say about this one, but I'll keep this for one of the next blog posts). I've also built an assembler for the MMIX architecture (described in The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth), and I'm working on a project that tries to find better strategies for the Brass Birmingham board game. Of course, I have other more minor projects or project ideas but I don't expect to delve(I saw a video that said that 'delve' is especially used by LLMs and now I feel weird using it) into them any time soon.

Besides projects, I'll also describe interesting ideas that I've stumbled upon. For example, I've recently started work as a Software Engineering Intern at a relatively large company and I'm currently learning more about testing pipelines and benchmarking, so expect me to talk more about these subjects. Especially benchmarking, I'll need to write benchmarks for some of my other projects and I've been postponing this since I don't know anything advanced about this subject.

And since it's related to work/personal projects, I'm currently going through some computer science books(when I have the time): Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann, Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud by Brendan Gregg, Digital Design and Computer Architecture (RISC-V Edition) by Sarah L. Harris and David Money Harris. So expect me to cover some of these subjects from these books, if I have the time.

That's it for this first post, hope I'll see you soon!
