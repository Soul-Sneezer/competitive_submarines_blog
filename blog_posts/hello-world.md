# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using the new markdown-based system. Isn't it exciting?

## Features of the New System

- Easy to write posts in markdown
- Automatic HTML generation
- Beautiful submarine navigation
- Responsive design

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## What's Next?
